# work-day-scheduler

## Description

The project of the week was to create a single work day scheduler. In this assignment we had to use Bootstrap to make to time block section and JQuery in our JavaScript. Through utilizing bootstrap and jquery the code of this assignment was greatly cut down. The functionality of this assignment is that you can add tasks to designated hours and then save them to local storage. The color of the time blocks change depending on the hour of the day. If it is the present hour the time block will be red, if it is a future time block it will be green and past time blocks shall be grey. Another key function of this assignment is the utilization of momentjs to assign the current day and time.

### What I Learned

This may not be something I have necessarily learned but something I have realized about the world of coding. Utilizing Bootstrap and JQuery has shown me that in web development it is better to use your resources rather than to put yourself through unnecessary amounts of work. Furthermore, JQuery and bootstrap have greatly helped me with understanding more about the fundamentals of JavaScript and HTML.
